## About Lunaria

Lunaria is an in-progress rewrite of Awesome, focusing on revamping the internal class system and Lua libraries
to make it easier to configure and write extensions for. The documentation will also be revisited and likely ported
over to mostly use [Sphinx](sphinx-doc.org). The rewrite will also make the existing codebase easier to expand upon,
and I plan to experiment with adding Wayland support. We'll see how it goes.

You can check the status of the rewrite in the Issues tab or the Projects tab. Lunaria is currently in the process of
working towards the [first port build](https://github.com/mousebyte/lunaria/milestone/1) milestone. The original
[README.md](docs/99-readme-old.md) is still available and contains legacy information about the project.
